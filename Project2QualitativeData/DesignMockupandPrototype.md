# Carl Newman's Faceless Nudes

[Link to prototype] (https://www.figma.com/file/qLKx6wOiKyuQGROphYg5zb/QualitativeViz?node-id=0%3A1)

### Description

Often times nude drawings are faceless. Is it because faces are hard to draw? Is it for the animosity of the model? Is it because naked bodies are more appealing than faces? In this visualization I analyze Carl Newmanâ€™s collection of nudes using facial recognition to detect if they have faces or not. Carl Newman was an American artist from Pennsylvania famous for his collection of nude figures. The Smithsonian houses a collection of 258 of these drawings. 

### Data

Smithsonian American Art Musuem's collection of nudes by Carl Newman. 258 Drawings total drawings.

### Applications Used

* D3.js for display of images
* P5.js and ML5.js for facial recognition
* Figma for prototype

### Color Scheme

I am using a white background and black lettering. I want to keep my color scheme neutral so I don't take away from the color in the images.

### Type Font

Open Sans (Bold for headers, regular for body text). I want to keep a neutral text font to not take away from the images.

### Coding Next Steps

* Find a way to loop through images and detect all faces and save them to a new file with all the face images
* Figure out how to parse the json data to have only the info you want so images will display correctly
* HTML coding and getting prototype onto a live webpage

### Things to Consider

* Changing the display of images to something other than a gallery view
