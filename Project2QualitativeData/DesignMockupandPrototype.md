### Description

Often times nude drawings are faceless. Is it because faces are hard to draw? Is it for the animosity of the model? Is it because naked bodies are more appealing than faces? In this visualization I analyze Carl Newmanâ€™s collection of nudes using facial recognition to detect if they have faces or not. Carl Newman was an American artist from Pennsylvania famous for his collection of nude figures. The Smithsonian houses a collection of 258 of these drawings.
