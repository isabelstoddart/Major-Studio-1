### Final dataset used
topicsDataReformattedHardcoded.json

### Things to Note
* Topics were split into 5 main groups (Science and Technology, Entertainers, Politics, Writers, and Society and Social Change). I only looked at topics pertaining to woman’s careers. I filtered out topics about the background of the image (i.e. chair, flowers) or the woman’s appearance (i.e. necklace, costume).

* Most of the politics topics pertain to women whose husbands work in politics, however I decided to still look at this genre because being a First Lady is still a career.

* The data analyzed is only the CC0 licensed data available through Smithsonian open access. The data does not account for all of the portraits of women in The National Portrait Gallery.

* I chose the dates 1900-1940 primarily because of the small set of data that is CC0 licensed. I took what I had to work with and then chose those takes secondly because it gives time before and after the women’s suffrage movement.

* The current bar graph was coded using example code from this source:

	I am new to d3.js so for now I am just using sample code but I need to 	change it up more before it is final and ready to be added to the final webpage.

* There are 182 portraits analyzed overall
